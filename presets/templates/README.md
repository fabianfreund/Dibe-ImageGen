## Creating Template Images

For production use, create actual 1280x720 PNG images with these characteristics using image editing software like:
- Adobe Photoshop
- Figma
- Canva
- GIMP

Or generate them using AI image generators with appropriate prompts.

## Placeholder Solution

Until actual images are created, the app will still function but templates without valid image files will show errors. Users can create and upload their own templates through the Template Manager UI.
